# My build of st (simple (suckless) terminal)
I use this to build st on my computers, but it's open for anyone to use

## Note:
This fork of st is largely based off of [Luke Smith's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st) fork of st

## Required packages, patches, fonts, etc.
- `fontawesome`: Adds custom icon support
- `Liberation Mono`: May or may not come pre-installed
- `libxft-bgra`: Required for unicode and emoji support
- `dmenu`: (optional) A very useful menu interface
